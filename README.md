* Because of a CORs issue, we will need to install Moesif Orign & CORS Changer extension on the chrome.
```

```
* git clone the repo
```
https://github.com/isaackps/tech-assessment
```
* install node packages
```
npm i
```
* Run the project
```
npm run start
```
* Upon loaded, a webpage will appear and you will be able to use the webapp. 
* Please give it sometime to load the content as it may take some time to get a response from the API.
* Note, Sometimes there is a network error and the page will fail to load, you just need to refresh the page and everything should be ok.
